### ASSIGNMENT INSTRUCTIONS FROM UCONN'S CODING BOOTCAMP

### SQL Challenge: Employee Tracker
Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). Your assignment this week is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

**IMPORTANT**<br>
In order to install inquirer, please use `npm i inquirer@8.2.4.`

Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to create a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the following acceptance criteria being met. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.

Refer to the Video Submission GuideLinks to an external site. on the Full-Stack Blog for additional guidance on creating a video.
